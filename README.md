# Flight_Delay_Causes
This dataset presents comprehensive data on flight arrivals and delays at U.S. airports, organized by carriers. It encompasses key metrics, including the count of arriving flights, delays exceeding 15 minutes, cancellation and diversion instances. Additionally, the dataset provides a granular breakdown of delays, attributing them to carriers, weather conditions, the National Airspace System (NAS), security issues, and late aircraft arrivals. 

The aim of the project is to delve into the dataset to scrutinize and evaluate the operational performance of distinct carriers across diverse airports over the specified time period as well as uncover valuable insights into the multifaceted factors influencing delays within the aviation industry.


**`Business Understanding`**
 - Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to analyze Flight Delay Data in the United States spanning August 2013 to August 2023. The dataset provides detailed information on flight arrivals, delays over 15 minutes, cancellations, diversions, and contributing factors such as carrier, weather, National Airspace System (NAS), security, and late aircraft arrivals.

1. **Project Objectives:**
 - Primary Goal: To identify and understand factors contributing to flight delays in U.S. carriers at various airports.
Specific Objectives:
 - Analyze patterns and trends in flight delays over the specified period.
 - Identify the primary reasons causing delays, categorizing them by carrier, weather, NAS, security, and late aircraft arrivals.
 - Explore relationships between different factors and delay occurrences.
 - Potentially develop predictive models to forecast future delays based on historical data.

2. **Stakeholders:**
 - Airlines and Airports: Insights can help optimize operations, scheduling, and resource allocation.
 - Passengers: Understanding delay patterns can manage expectations and enhance the travel experience.
 - Aviation Authorities: Findings can aid in enforcing regulations and improving safety measures.

3. **Key Metrics and Success Criteria:**
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
 - On-time arrival rates (%)
 - Average delay time (in minutes)
 - Cancellation/diversion rates (%)
Success Criteria: Identifying the top three contributors to delays.

4. **Risks and Limitations:**
 - Data Quality: Potential issues with missing data, inconsistencies, or biases.
 - Scope Limitations: Constraints within the dataset might limit the depth of analysis.

5. **Project Plan and Timeline:**
Work Breakdown Structure:
 - Data acquisition and preprocessing
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Feature engineering and modeling
 - Model evaluation and interpretation
Timeline: Estimated timeframes for each phase.

6. **Communication Plan:**
 - Reporting and Visualization: Using R's visualization libraries to create interactive dashboards or reports.

**`Data Acquisition and Understanding`**<br/>  

1. **Data Source Verification**:<br/>

Using R to load the dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriharshaeedala/airline-delay) .<br/>

Confirm the dataset contains the expected columns: <br/>
year: The year of the data. <br/>
month: The month of the data.<br/>
carrier: Carrier code.<br/>
carrier_name: Carrier name.<br/>
airport: Airport code.<br/>
airport_name: Airport name.<br/>
arr_flights: Number of arriving flights.<br/>
arr_del15: Number of flights delayed by 15 minutes or more.<br/>
carrier_ct: Carrier count (delay due to the carrier).<br/>
weather_ct: Weather count (delay due to weather).<br/>
nas_ct: NAS (National Airspace System) count (delay due to the NAS).<br/>
security_ct: Security count (delay due to security).<br/>
late_aircraft_ct: Late aircraft count (delay due to late aircraft arrival).<br/>
arr_cancelled: Number of flights canceled.<br/>
arr_diverted: Number of flights diverted.<br/>
arr_delay: Total arrival delay.<br/>
carrier_delay: Delay attributed to the carrier.<br/>
weather_delay: Delay attributed to weather.<br/>
nas_delay: Delay attributed to the NAS.<br/>
security_delay: Delay attributed to security.<br/>
late_aircraft_delay: Delay attributed to late aircraft arrival.<br/>

Ensure the dataset spans the period from August 2013 to August 2023 as specified.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:<br/>
 - Data Loading: Use R's functions (e.g., read.csv()) to load the dataset into a data frame.
 - Preliminary Analysis: Perform a head/tail check (head(), tail()), summary statistics (summary()), and structure check (str()) to understand the dataset's structure and contents.
 - Handling Missing Values: Identify missing values using functions like is.na() or complete.cases() and decide on appropriate handling strategies (imputation or removal).
 - Check Data Types: Ensure appropriate data types (numeric, factor, date, etc.) for each column using class() or typeof() functions.
   
3. **Attribute Understanding**:<br/>
 - Column Meanings: Review column names and descriptions from the dataset documentation (if available) to understand each attribute's meaning and relevance.
 - Categorical Variables: Identify categorical variables like carrier, airport, etc., and consider encoding or converting them for analysis.
 - Numerical Variables: Understand the range and distribution of numerical variables such as arr_del15, arr_delay, etc., using histograms or boxplots (hist(), boxplot()).

4. **Data Cleaning**:<br/>
 - Handling Missing Values: Address missing values by imputation (e.g., mean, median) or removal based on the impact and context of missingness.
 - Dealing with Outliers: Identify and handle outliers using visualization techniques or statistical methods like z-scores or IQR.
 - Data Transformation: Apply transformations (e.g., log transformation) if necessary to normalize distributions.
   
5. **Initial Data Visualization**:<br/>
Create basic visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms, scatterplots) using R's visualization libraries (ggplot2, plotly) to explore relationships and patterns within the data.

6. **Summary and Documentation**:<br/>
Document observations, initial insights, and potential next steps.
